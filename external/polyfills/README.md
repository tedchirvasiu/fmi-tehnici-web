classList.js is a cross-browser JavaScript shim that fully implements `element.classList`. Refer to [the MDN page on `element.classList`][1] for more information.

This works in every browser except IE 7 or earlier.

classList.js is available on these public CDN URLs, allowing you to use this already small file at nearly zero size overhead.
